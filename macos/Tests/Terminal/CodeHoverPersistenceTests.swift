/// The hover fetch's own lifecycle, independent of whether a card ever gets
/// drawn on screen.
///
/// Every `hoverProvider` here returns an **empty** `CodeHoverInfo`. That is
/// deliberate, not incidental: `mouseMoved`'s guard —
/// `guard !Task.isCancelled, let info, !info.isEmpty else { return }` — reads
/// it as "nothing to show" and returns before ever calling `showHover`, which
/// is what calls into `CodeHoverPanel.present` and, through it, `orderFront`.
/// Asking the real window server to display a window from this test host —
/// which has no running `NSApplication` event loop to pump its replies —
/// hangs that call forever rather than returning, and hangs the whole suite
/// with it. Returning empty info lets these tests observe everything that
/// happens *before* that line — which is exactly where the regression below
/// lived — without ever reaching it.
///
/// Driving `mouseMoved`/`mouseExited` directly, rather than through a real
/// tracking area, is safe here for the same reason `isJumpClick` was split
/// out to be tested apart from `mouseDown`: the documented hazard is
/// specifically `mouseDown`'s superclass implementation, which runs an
/// event-tracking loop waiting for a mouse-up that never comes outside a
/// live window. `mouseMoved` and `mouseExited` carry no such loop.
