/// coordinator is the only component that combines them, so each pane
/// asks for its treatment instead of deciding locally.
///
/// The resolution map:
///
///     blur = off / radius, opacity = 1
///       window: solid effective background
///       terminal: theme background (opaque)
///       sidebar: theme → effective background; window → nothing;
///                custom → tint color at tint opacity
///
///     blur = off / radius, opacity < 1
///       window: near-transparent (CGS blur when radius), desktop shows
///       terminal: theme background at opacity (Metal)
///       sidebar: same rules as above — theme mode mirrors the terminal
///
/// Every pane paints the same colour in every mode, which is what keeps
/// the surface seamless. The system glass material was a third mode until
/// it proved it can't do that: it is applied per-view, so the sidebar and
/// the terminal each got their own and the boundary between them always
/// showed. "Glass" in the settings is the blurred background above.
///
/// The window-level treatment itself is applied by
/// `TerminalWindow.syncAppearance`; the divider by `SidebarSplitView`.
