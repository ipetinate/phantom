/// Splits a single-file component into the languages it is actually made of.
///
/// A `.vue` file is not one language. Lexing the whole thing as JavaScript —
/// which is what happens when the extension maps straight to it — colours
/// `class` in the template as a JavaScript keyword, leaves every HTML tag
/// plain, and does nothing at all with the stylesheet. Three regions, three
/// rule sets.
///
/// **The boundary rule: an SFC's blocks start at column zero.** That is how
/// the splitter tells the file's own `<template>` from a `<template #slot>`
/// nested inside it — the nested one is indented, always, because it is
/// inside something. It is a convention rather than a parse, so the failure
/// mode is worth stating: a nested block written flush to the left margin
/// would end the outer one early. Every formatter in this ecosystem indents
/// it, and the alternative is carrying a real HTML parser to colour text.
///
/// **This is a colouring-pass tool, not one for the typing path.** Every
/// call compiles three regular expressions and scans the whole document
/// three times, with nothing cached — fine once per highlight, unaffordable
/// once per keystroke. Anything reacting to a keypress wants a probe, not a
/// partition; `CodeTagClose` carries one.
